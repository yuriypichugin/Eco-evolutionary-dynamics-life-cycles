Code and data for the paper "Eco-evolutionary dynamics of clonal multicellular life cycles"

Each folder contains files related to one of the figures in the manuscript. Structures of these folders are similar:

# 01 Simulation code

Contains the python code producing the dataset to plot. In some cases, the code should be run on a cluster. There, the submitter script .sh is provided along with slurm instructions in script subfolder.

# 02 Data

The dataset to plot. All files are archived and need an unpack before using.

# 03 Plot code
